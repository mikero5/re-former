- left off at 'Set up the Back End' step 11.

- attempting to do edit mod
  -- need to complete the edit method in the controller
  -- need to ensure the PATCH (PUT) http method is used...
  -- see current mods in files:
     --- edit.html.erb
     --- users_controller.rb
     --- routes.rb (note: I added the :edit resource, but the tutorial didn't specify doing that)

- used the technique used by the project 'get your feet wet' to complete the edit functionality.
  -- this uses form_with instead of form_for
  -- hopefully, this will be good enough to use as an example for future projects.
